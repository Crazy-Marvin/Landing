- Main Content

    - slider with YouTube video and __screenshots__
    - description of the app

- Footer

  - _left side_: __Terms of Service__ (popup) & __Privacy Policy__ (popup)

  - _right side_: __contact (mailto)__, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord & Telegram

- Analytics

  - __[Matomo](https://matomo.org/)__, [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/), [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) and/or [Google Analytics](https://www.analytics.google.com)
