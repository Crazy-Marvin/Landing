# Landing - Template For Simple &amp; Clean Landingpages

The landing page consists of basically three parts:

- Header

  - _left side_: __icon__ & __name of the app__
  - _right side_: links to F-Droid, Google Play, Docs, Help & GitHub (link or [banner](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners))

- Main Content

    - slider with YouTube video and __screenshots__
    - description of the app

- Footer

  - _left side_: __Terms of Service__ (popup) & __Privacy Policy__ (popup)

  - _right side_: __contact (mailto)__, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord & Telegram

Necessary parts are written in __bold__. Other stuff is optional.
